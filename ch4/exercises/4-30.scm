;; Ben is right because  both 'newline' and 'display' are primitive.
;; 1. for-each is evaluated
;; 2. (lambda (x) (newline) (display x)) and (list 57 321 88) become thunk.
;; 3. During for-each evaluation, `items` which is (list 57 321 88) is forced
;;    because null? is primitive, and (null? items) is evaluated as false.
;; 4. Next, in 'begin' in for-each evaluation, 'proc' which is the thunk
;;    (lambda (x) (newline) (display x)) is forced because operator is always
;;    forced in 'apply', but (cdr items) become thunk.
;; 5. In (proc (car items)), 'car' is primitive, then evaluated as 57.
;; 6. 'newline' and 'display' are primitive functions then they are forced and display
;;    a blank line and '57'
;; 7. (for-each proc (cdr items)) in the next sequence become thunk at first
;;    but 'eval' forces it soon and loop from 1.

;; At the exp (p (set! x (cons x '(2))))), p is forced, and  (set! x (cons x '(2)))) becomes thunk.
;; In the p's process, the first e which is (set! x (cons x '(2))) is forced because Cy's version calls 'actual-value' and x becomes '(1 2)

;; (lambda (x) (newline) (display x)) is composed with only primitive functions,

;; ex4-30 d.
;; I think Cy's is better, because it is unpredictable whether expressions are forced or delayed without reading the partial codes, and it is not desirable to have to think whether the focusing function is primitive or not.
