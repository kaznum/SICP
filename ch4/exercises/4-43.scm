;; Mary Ann Moore’s father has a yacht and so has each of
;; his four friends: Colonel Downing, Mr. Hall, Sir Barnacle
;; Hood, and Dr. Parker. Each of the five also has one daughter
;; and each has named his yacht after a daughter of one of
;; the others. Sir Barnacle’s yacht is the Gabrielle, Mr. Moore
;; owns the Lorna; Mr. Hall the Rosalind. The Melissa, owned
;; by Colonel Downing, is named after Sir Barnacle’s daughter.
;; Gabrielle’s father owns the yacht that is named after
;; Dr. Parker’s daughter. Who is Lorna’s father?
;; Try to write the program so that it runs efficiently (see Exercise
;; 4.40). Also determine how many solutions there are
;; if we are not told that Mary Ann’s last name is Moore.

;; Solution A.
;; It is more efficient if distinct is as lazy as possible
;; because the other requirements restrict the size of possible alternatives
