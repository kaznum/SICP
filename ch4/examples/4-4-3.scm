;; If supervisors is less than programmer,

;; The aim of logical programming is to provide the programmers
;; the technique of decomposing 'what' is to be computed and 'how' that should be computed.

;; 'Rule' holds the 'way' to compute the problem procedurally in body, at the same time,
;; this can be regarded as the 'statement(what)' of methematical logic (inference).
