;; Given
(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
	  (accumulate op initial (cdr sequence)))))


;; Answer
(define (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms)
		(+ this-coeff (* x higher-terms)))
	      0
	      coefficient-sequence))


;; 1 + 3x + 5x^3 + x^(5) at x = 2
(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
;; 79
